## Creating a Post
This guide will walk you through how to login and create a post on pingg.
1. To access the posting feature, you will first need to create an account. In this guide, we will create the account using an email address, but you may also choose to link an account using a different service.
    1. Go to http://pingg.tech and click “Sign in with email.”
    2. Type your desired email address into the prompt and click “NEXT.” A new dialog will appear asking for your name and password.
    3. Enter your first and last name in the appropriate field and then enter your desired account password to be used in future logins.
    4. Click “SAVE” to finalize your information.
2. Once you have created your account, you will see the pingg homepage, from which you can create a new post.
3. On the homepage, click on the red “New Post” button. A pop-up window will appear with a Title field, a Post field, and a Tags field.
4. This guide will demonstrate how to create a text post, but you can also create an image or video post following a similar process.
    1. First, set the title for your post by clicking the title field and typing up to 200 characters.
    2. In the Post field, click “Text” from among the three available buttons to create a text post.
    3. A text field will appear, in which you will type your desired post content. You can format the text in a variety of ways using the buttons provided at the bottom of the box.
    4. Click on the Tags field and type desired search tags for your post. Separate each tag using a comma. The tags will attempt to autocomplete as you type them, and you can press Tab while typing a tag to autocomplete it and move on to the next tag.
5. Once you have filled out the three fields in the New Post window, click the “Post” button in the bottom right of the window to finalize the post and make it public.
6. Hover over your profile icon at the top of the screen and select “Profile” to view your profile page. Your new post will be visible on this page under the “Posts” heading.
